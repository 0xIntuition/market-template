## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- pnpm 9.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Copy the environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Fill out the environment variables in the `.env` file
5. Run `pnpm new-wallet` to generate a new wallet to power your back-end. It will need to be funded in order to tag atoms that were created via your app.
6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## üöÄ Deployment

Want to deploy this app quickly? Use the button below to deploy to Render:

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/0xIntuition/market-template)

> Note: You'll need to configure environment variables in the Render dashboard after deployment.

- The Intuition MultiVault address is `0x1A6950807E33d5bC9975067e6D6b5Ea4cD661665`
- You will need an API Key, Environment ID, and Public Key for Dynamic.XYZ
- You will need to generate a wallet and provide the private and public keys to the ENV
- You will need an App Name and App Description for both the server and the client
- The client uses this visually, whereas the server uses this to create a special atom for your app.
- Hop into our discord if you have any questions!

The project includes a `render.yaml` file that configures the deployment settings for Render. This file:

- Sets up a web service with the appropriate build and start commands
- Pre-configures some environment variables
- Includes a health check endpoint
- Marks sensitive environment variables that you'll need to set manually

## üß© Project Structure

- `src/app`: Next.js app router pages and API routes
- `src/components`: Reusable UI components
- `src/lib`: Utility functions and contract integrations
- `src/server`: Server-side logic and API handlers
- `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `src/styles`: Global styles and theme configuration

## üíª Development

- Add additional providers to `providers.tsx` (already wrapping `layout.tsx`)
- Add pages directly to the `app` directory following Next's app router conventions
- Theming is set up and pulls from `1ui` - any Shad components or Tailwind you write will respect this theme
- Recommended to add Shad components via the CLI, run in the root of this directory

## üìù Scripts

- `pnpm dev`: Start development server with Turbopack
- `pnpm build`: Build the application for production
- `pnpm start`: Start the production server
- `pnpm lint`: Run ESLint
- `pnpm typecheck`: Run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm new-wallet`: Generate a new wallet to power your back-end
